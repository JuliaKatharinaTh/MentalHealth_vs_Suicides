# MentalHealth_vs_Suicides

## 🎯 Objective 
To build an interactive dashboard visually showcasing well-curated results of an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.

In this case study, we'll explore if there is a correlation between the Suicide Rates and Mental Health Services that are offered.

The hypothesis is: The more Mental Health Services are offered, the less Suicides there are.
